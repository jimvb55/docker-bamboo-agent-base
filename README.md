A Bamboo Agent is a service that can run job builds. Each agent has a defined set of capabilities and can run builds only for jobs whose requirements match the agent's capabilities.
To learn more about Bamboo, see: https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo

If you are looking for **Bamboo Server Docker Image** it can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/bamboo-server/).

# Overview

This Docker container makes it easy to get a Bamboo Remote Agent up and running. It is intended to be used as a base to build from, and as such
contains limited built-in capabilities:

* JDK 11
* Git & Git LFS
* Maven 3
* Python 3

Using this image as a base, you can create a custom remote agent image with your
desired build tools installed. Note that Bamboo Agent Docker Image does not
include a Bamboo server.

# Quick Start

# Quick Start

For the `BAMBOO_HOME` directory that is used to store the repository data (amongst other things) we recommend mounting a host directory as a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/data-volumes), or via a named volume if using a docker version >= 1.9.

To get started you can use a data volume, or named volumes. In this example we'll use named volumes.

    $> docker volume create --name bambooAgentVolume
    $> docker run -e BAMBOO_SERVER=http://bamboo.mycompany.com/agentServer/ -v bambooVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/bamboo --name="bambooAgent" --hostname="bambooAgent" -d atlassian/bamboo-agent-base

**Success**. The Bamboo remote agent is now available to be approved in your Bamboo administration.


## Configuration

* `BAMBOO_SERVER` (required)

   The URL of the Bamboo Server the remote agent should connect to, e.g. `http://bamboo.mycompany.com/agentServer/`

* `SECURITY_TOKEN` (default: NONE)

   If security token verification is enabled, this value specifies the token required to authenticate to the Bamboo server

* `WRAPPER_JAVA_INITMEMORY` (default: 256)

   The minimum heap size of the JVM. This value is in MB and should be specified as an integer

* `WRAPPER_JAVA_MAXMEMORY` (default: 512)

   The maximum heap size of the JVM. This value is in MB and should be specified as an integer

* `IGNORE_SERVER_CERT_NAME` (default: false)

   Ignore SSL verification for the Bamboo server, e.g. if Bamboo is using a self-signed certificate

* `ALLOW_EMPTY_ARTIFACTS` (default: false)

   Allow empty directories to be published as artifacts

# Extending base image

This Docker image contains only minimal setup to run a Bamboo agent which might not be sufficient to run your builds. If you need additional capabilities you can extend the image to suit your needs.

Example of extending the agent base image by Maven and Git:

    FROM atlassian/bamboo-agent-base
    USER root
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install maven -y && \
        apt-get install git -y
        
    USER ${BAMBOO_USER}
    RUN ${BAMBOO_USER_HOME}/bamboo-update-capability.sh "system.builder.mvn3.Maven 3.3" /usr/share/maven
    RUN ${BAMBOO_USER_HOME}/bamboo-update-capability.sh "system.git.executable" /usr/bin/git

# Supported JDK versions

All the Atlassian Docker images are now JDK 11 only, and generated from the
[official AdoptOpenJDK Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk11).

The Docker images follow the [Atlassian Support end-of-life
policy](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html);
images for unsupported versions of the products remain available but will no longer
receive updates or fixes.

However, Bamboo is an exception to this. Due to the need to support JDK 11 and
Kubernetes, we currently only generate new images for Bamboo 8.0 and up. Legacy
builds for JDK 8 are still available in Docker Hub, and building custom images
is available (see above).

Historically, we have also generated other versions of the images, including
JDK 8, Alpine, and 'slim' versions of the JDK. These legacy images still exist in
Docker Hub, however they should be considered deprecated, and do not receive
updates or fixes.

If for some reason you need a different version, see "Building your own image".

# Building your own image

* Clone the Atlassian repository at https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-docker/docker-bamboo-server/
* Modify or replace the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates
  under `config`; _NOTE_: The files must have the `.j2` extensions. However you
  don't have to use template variables if you don't wish.
* Build the new image with e.g: `docker build --tag my-bamboo-image --build-arg BAMBOO_VERSION=8.x.x .`
* Optionally push to a registry, and deploy.
