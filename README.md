A Bamboo Agent is a service that can run job builds. Each agent has a defined set of capabilities and can run builds only for jobs whose requirements match the agent's capabilities.
To learn more about Bamboo, see: https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo

If you are looking for **Bamboo Server Docker Image** it can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/bamboo-server/).

# Overview

This Docker container makes it easy to get a Bamboo Remote Agent up and running. It is intended to be used as a base to build from, and as such
contains limited built-in capabilities:

* JDK 11
* Git & Git LFS
* Maven 3
* Python 3

Using this image as a base, you can create a custom remote agent image with your
desired build tools installed. Note that Bamboo Agent Docker Image does not
include a Bamboo server.

** Use docker version >= 20.10.9. **

# Quick Start

For the `BAMBOO_HOME` directory that is used to store the repository data (amongst other things) we recommend mounting a host directory as a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/data-volumes), or via a named volume.

To get started you can use a data volume, or named volumes. In this example we'll use named volumes.

Run as a standard Agent:

    $> docker volume create --name bambooAgentVolume
    $> docker run -e BAMBOO_SERVER=http://bamboo.mycompany.com/agentServer/ -v bambooVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/bamboo --name="bambooAgent" --hostname="bambooAgent" -d atlassian/bamboo-agent-base

Run as an Ephemeral Agent (requires Bamboo version >= 9.1.1):

    $> docker run -e BAMBOO_SERVER=http://bamboo.mycompany.com/agentServer/ -e SECURITY_TOKEN={{YOUR_TOKEN}} -e AGENT_EPHEMERAL_FOR_KEY={{YOUR_RESULT_KEY}} -e AGENT_EPHEMERAL_TEMPLATE_ID={{YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID}} -e AGENT_EPHEMERAL_POD_NAME={{YOUR_POD_NAME}} -e KUBE_NUM_EXTRA_CONTAINERS={{NUMBER_OF_EXTRA_CONTAINERS}} --name="bambooAgent" --hostname="bambooAgent" -d atlassian/bamboo-agent-base

**Success**. The Bamboo remote agent is now available to be approved in your Bamboo administration.


## Configuration

* `BAMBOO_SERVER` (required)

   The URL of the Bamboo Server the remote agent should connect to, e.g. `http://bamboo.mycompany.com/agentServer/`

* `SECURITY_TOKEN` (default: NONE)

   If security token verification is enabled, this value specifies the token required to authenticate to the Bamboo server

* `WRAPPER_JAVA_INITMEMORY` (default: 256)

   The minimum heap size of the JVM. This value is in MB and should be specified as an integer

* `WRAPPER_JAVA_MAXMEMORY` (default: 512)

   The maximum heap size of the JVM. This value is in MB and should be specified as an integer

* `IGNORE_SERVER_CERT_NAME` (default: false)

   Ignore SSL certificate hostname if it's issued to a different host than the one under your Bamboo Base URL hostname

* `ALLOW_EMPTY_ARTIFACTS` (default: false)

   Allow empty directories to be published as artifacts

* `BAMBOO_AGENT_PERMISSIVE_READINESS` (default: unset/false)

   If set to 'true', the readiness probe will be more permissive and not expect
   the agent to be fully configured, only that the startup wrapper is
   running. This is primarily intended for use when deploying agents into
   environments where the server may not yet be configured.

## Ephemeral agent specific configuration

* `AGENT_EPHEMERAL_FOR_KEY` (default: NONE)

  If used together with `AGENT_EPHEMERAL_TEMPLATE_ID`, the image will be launched in the ephemeral agents' mode, the value itself specifies the purpose for spawning the agent. It needs to be a valid ResultKey.

* `AGENT_EPHEMERAL_TEMPLATE_ID` (default: NONE)

  If used together with `AGENT_EPHEMERAL_FOR_KEY`, the image will be launched in the ephemeral agents' mode, the value itself specifies the template ID the agent is launched within.

* `KUBE_NUM_EXTRA_CONTAINERS` (default: 0) 

  The number of extra containers that run in parallel with the Bamboo Agent. We make sure these extra containers are run before the Agent kick in.

* `EXTRA_CONTAINERS_REGISTRATION_DIRECTORY` (default: /pbc/kube)

  The directory where extra containers should register their readiness by creating any file. The image waits for having `KUBE_NUM_EXTRA_CONTAINERS` number of files inside this directory (if the one exists) before processing further and running the actual agent.


# Extending base image

This Docker image contains only minimal setup to run a Bamboo agent which might not be sufficient to run your builds. If you need additional capabilities you can extend the image to suit your needs.

Example of extending the agent base image by Maven and Git:

    FROM atlassian/bamboo-agent-base:8.2.1
    USER root
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install maven -y && \
        apt-get install git -y
        
    USER ${BAMBOO_USER}
    RUN /bamboo-update-capability.sh "system.builder.mvn3.Maven 3.3" /usr/share/maven
    RUN /bamboo-update-capability.sh "system.git.executable" /usr/bin/git

# Building your own image

* Clone the Atlassian repository at https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-docker/docker-bamboo-agent-base/
* Modify or replace the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates
  under `config`; _NOTE_: The files must have the `.j2` extensions. However you
  don't have to use template variables if you don't wish.
* Build the new image with e.g: `docker build --build-arg BAMBOO_VERSION=X.Y.Z --tag my-agent-image .`
* Optionally push to a registry, and deploy.

# Supported JDK versions

All the Atlassian Docker images are now JDK 11 only, and generated from the
[official Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin).

The Docker images follow the [Atlassian Support end-of-life
policy](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html);
images for unsupported versions of the products remain available but will no longer
receive updates or fixes.

However, Bamboo is an exception to this. Due to the need to support JDK 11 and
Kubernetes, we currently only generate new images for Bamboo 8.0 and up. Legacy
builds for JDK 8 are still available in Docker Hub, and building custom images
is available (see above).

Historically, we have also generated other versions of the images, including
JDK 8, Alpine, and 'slim' versions of the JDK. These legacy images still exist in
Docker Hub, however they should be considered deprecated, and do not receive
updates or fixes.

If for some reason you need a different version, see "Building your own image".
